# ClaRa-openDevelopment

The purpose of this repository is to establish a potential publication platform for third-party models originating from the ever-expanding ClaRa users' community.
The open-source Modelica library ClaRa (https://github.com/xrg-simulation/ClaRa-official) provides its users with the capability to proficiently tackle tasks in the disciplines of thermal hydraulics and instrumentation and control pertaining to power plants and other kind of energy systems.
 
ClaRa usesrs can readily upload their models. To ensure optimal usability, there are specific requirements for these new models. 
Introductory examples and declarative comments are mandatory for new users to allow a quick access to the library. Well structured parameter dialogues and a self-explanatory and consistent nomenclature, 
as well as a good source code transparency and documentation are important too. Following a comprehensive quality check, models and their corresponding documentation can be considered for integration 
into the official ClaRa release if there is sufficient user interest.

To make sure everyone is protected and ClaRa can keep growing, all contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement (ClaRa-openDevelopment/CLA.pdf). 
Basically, it means that contributors give the ClaRa Development team (CDT) permission to publish their work in the ClaRa library, currently under 3-clause-BSD License. 
In return, the CDT assures to always make the contributions available as open source in ClaRa.
